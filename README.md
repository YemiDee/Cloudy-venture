# Cloudy

This repo documents my sojourn in the land of DevOps. 

I have IACs (Infrastructure As a Code) written in both Terraform and Python to build various AWS infrastructures. Terraform is more popular in deploying AWS infrastructures, but I decided to explore Python using the Boto3 module to replicate same workflow from Terraform. They both have their pros and cons, but it is richly rewarding to explore and grow your skillset.

Warning
Codes in this repo may not be ready for production. For now, please consider its primary use as an example for creating and destroying infrastructures. Feel free to fork, implement, improve and give feedback on improvements made for the progress of DevOps community.
